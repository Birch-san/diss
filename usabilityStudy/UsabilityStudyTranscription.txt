First system, Flyouts ON.

Start the system by pressing Apple K.
	Okay, is there an Apple on here?
Yeah, I’ve mapped Ctrl to Apple.
	Okay, great.
	I’ll do what I have to do to get started, and…
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
	Okay.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to search for the Olympics.
	Oh, search, okay, so…
*Presses indicated key to drill toward top-right quadrant, where search is*
// No instruction required on how to point, or what keys to use!
	And now, the question is… oh, I see.
*Continues drilling toward search box*

	Uh, it keeps coming…
*Continues drilling toward search box.*
[Field is now in crosshairs.]
	Ah!
	Am I there yet?
*Guesses key*
	Nope. Do I have to hit return or something?
*Hits return*
*Search field is selected*
// No instructions required!
*Types Olympics, submits search*

	Who would search for the olympics… haha! Okay, now what?
	I might have to do the same again. Ctrl K?
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
	Okay, what have I got to do?

Let me think, what would be a good idea.. try and hit that article, Sochi 2014 [top result].
	Hm, oh the first Sochi 2012? Sochi 2014, dude! Haha.
	The one with that guy, the one with the picture.
*Drills toward article*
*Drills toward article*
	And it’s missed the link..
	Oh, I see.
*Activates an appropriate flyout*
// Unprompted! Only one lookup later than expert perf.
	It does that. Very clever of you, that extra thing.

	Hm, okay. This is great! I would totally take this.
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
	Especially as it’s keyboard, and it saves you from moving to it.
	And it’s not slower than, uh, mouse; you don’t have to move it to. So that’s great.
	I used to keep the mouse on this; it’s obnoxiously slow. I used to use that in 1998, when I was working for Lego, I was so screwed up I did use that sometimes.
	Anyway, yes.

Now click on Sport.
Err, that sport.
	Oh, that sport up there.
*Drills toward*
	Mm, (counting noises)
*Presses wrong flyout*
	Oops, missed. So what’s the back button?
Backspace.
*Presses back*

	Let’s try again.
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
	Okay.
*Drills toward*
	Mm.
*Again activates inappropriate flyout*
	Ah, it’s, it’s.. there’s something wrong.
	I hate to tell you this, but I’m definitely clicking on the right thing. Haha.

Okay, uh..
	I guess I could therefore try to compensate for that one, cause..
*Drills toward*
I dunno how much I should say..
*Activates correct flyout*
	Yeah, okay. I compensated, but there’s definitely something wrong. Haha.

Okay, how about a different website; go to Amazon.
*Changes website*
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
Let’s do a… I dunno; let’s do a search.
	Okay.
*Drills toward*
*Many flyouts appear close together with tags tying them to their buttons in various directions*
	Hah! That’s really all over.
*Presses appropriate flyout for search field*
Hm, what’s your favourite book?
	[search term redacted]
	[discussion of how to select suggested products using arrow keys on accessible input device]
*search submitted*

Try and click on [author for first result redacted].
*Some unproductive inputs [accessible input device typing in wrong mode]*
	Hello?
	Oh, I’ve got to…
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*Drills toward*
*Presses appropriate flyout*
//  Expert performance already!

I wonder if that’s enough for Amazon. Let’s go to Wikipedia.
Looks like it’s already selected the input field. Shall we pretend it didn’t?
	Why? Why don’t you just have me go to the German [Wikipedia] or something?
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
	Let’s go to the German one.
Okay.
*Presses appropriate flyout*
// No drilling required!

	Okay, now what?
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*Drills toward search*
*Drills toward search*
*Drills toward search*
German foods?
*Presses appropriate flyout*
*Searches currywurst*

Let’s go to the bottom; there should be some interesting markup there.
*Scrolls to end*
Alright, let’s go to Über Wikipedia.
	Alright.
*Drills toward*
*Presses appropriate flyout*

[Discussion to find an inaccessible website to navigate next]

*Google searches Bath Chronicle.*
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*Presses key for appropriate flyout*
*Bug in Chibipoint means the key press is caught by Google instead*
	That’s interesting. So the ‘J’ got captured.
*More typing*
	Yeah, every time you type something, Google’s capturing it.
	Yeah, so, can’t… it’s just totally failing now.

Yeah, there’s still other ways to use Google with the keyboard.
I found this earlier. I don’t know how to make my key listeners the highest priority.
It’s JavaScript injected into the page, so it’s fighting the rest of the page.
	So we can cheat briefly.
*Clicks news article of Bath Chronicle*

	So now..
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
	So what do you want me to click?
*Drills toward top-left*
Click ‘place an advert’.
*Presses appropriate flyout*

Register. Let’s see how it does with forms.
	Okay.
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*Drills toward Register*
*Closes Chibipoint accidentally*
	Oops.
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*(Immediately) drills to original position*
// Appears to be able to reproduce practiced spatial traversals quickly without pausing to think.
	…That’s a ’Z’; okay. [Text was obscured, so appeared as numeral 7]
*Drills toward*
*Drills toward*
[No flyouts have appeared for this button; clickable detection failed, so crosshairs are the only option. It’s now in crosshairs.]
*Presses enter*

[A form appears]
*Tabs a few times to enter form*
// Candidate seems to notice that both systems can co-exist. This tab journey was a short one.
	Oops.
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
[First 6 fields of form have flyouts suggested, without drilling.]
*Presses flyout for first form element*
*Focuses drop-down menu*
	Heh. Yeah, thanks. [Presumably wanted menu to open, as with a real click].
*Starts filling out form (unprompted) without Chibipoint*
*Accidentally closes window.*

*Restores window.*
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*Drills toward ‘Address lookup’ button*
*Drills toward [non-trivial because it’s on an edge after each drill, and also because no flyouts are offered; clickables detection failed]*
*Drills toward [now in crosshairs]*
*Presses Return*
*Address lookup is clicked; panel appears overlaying existing content*

*Presses tab to attempt to focus panel*
*Keyboard focus leaves browser*
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*Attempts to drill, but keyboard focus is in the address bar; types into address instead.*
[Much attempting to regain focus and resume drilling, but even tabbing fails]
[Resort to mouse click to put focus back in browser content pane]

*Drills toward address*
*Drills toward*
*Drills toward address [now in crosshairs, though never detected by flyouts]*
*Presses return*
*Click sent, element flashes, but no change in form*
// Without mouseover probing, we cannot get affordances for which element needs to be clicked, and confused results can occur.
[Attempt to verify using mouse which element is meant to be clicked]
[Panel closes]

[Recover panel by refreshing page and re-opening Address lookup]
[Clicks same element again with Chibipoint; form option remains unclicked]
	It must want [me to click] the checkbox next to it.
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*Drills toward*
*Drills toward*
*Drills toward*
[Button is not yet in crosshairs. Drilling labels now hidden since grid is small.]
	Hmh.
*Presses return*
	Yeah, I have no idea. It doesn’t seem to be..
	So, does that..
*Hovers mouse over to confirm feedback*
	[The button] doesn’t seem to notice [with Chibipoint] that something’s there.
	Obviously there’s no signal that [an emulated mouse cursor is above].
	‘Cause the [cursor] changes into a hand when you hover over it.
[Repeats previous navigation:]
*Presses Apple K*
*Chibipoint interface appears*
*Drills toward*
*Drills toward*
*Drills toward*
[Button is not yet in crosshairs. Drilling labels now hidden since grid is small.]
*Presses return*
// Seems to think that when the drilling labels are gone, it is not possible to continue drilling.

*Reopens Chibipoint, drills lightly into an alternative journey.*
*Closes Chibipoint without clicking*

*Reopens Chibipoint, redoing a previous journey.*
	Yeah, nothing I do seems to get the tick.
Try pressing [bottom-left quadrant (now unlabelled)]
*Drills*
And again.
*Drills*
You can inch closer.

Boxes aren’t perfect sub-boxes; they grow a little bit.
	Okay. I didn’t see Z as an action, so…
Ah. Yes, it… I can’t make text any smaller.
	Well, is that enough information?

*Presses Apple K*
