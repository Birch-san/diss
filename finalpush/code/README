Source code license is GNU GPL v3. Full text available in file `LICENSE`.


=Installation:
Using Google Chrome,
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Ensure `Developer mode` at the top is checked.
3. `Load unpacked extension`
4. Choose this folder, `chibipoint`.
5. ChibiPoint should appear in your list of Extensions, and be `Enabled`.
6. If you wish, you can customise the invocation shortcut using the `Keyboard Shortcuts` link at the bottom of chrome://extensions/


=Invocation:
Browse the web as usual.
Press Cmd+K (Mac) / Ctrl+K (Windows) to invoke ChibiPoint interface.

You should see a grid. If you don't, that's bad. Probably an installation or keybinding problem.


=Usage:
Press the shortcuts you see on the grid to `drill down' in that direction.
Labels fly out from suggested clickables. These `flyouts' can be invoked by pressing their corresponding key.

By default, you drill with the numpad directions.
Flyout shortcuts are mapped to a 3x3 grid on the left hand of a Qwerty keyboard.

Caps lock is not supported.


=Customizing keys:
By default we use numpad to `drill down'. If you don't have a numpad, you should probably change the code a little.

Lines 80-154 concern keybindings. Sorry the world isn't nicer.
There are a few defaults you might want to try out, so fiddle around with numpad = true and Dvorak = false.

Just edit the code, and refresh any page that was using ChibiPoint; it should update immediately.
